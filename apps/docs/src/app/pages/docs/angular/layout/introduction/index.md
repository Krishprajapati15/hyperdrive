`ngx-layout` is a collection of Angular components related to layout.

`ngx-layout` is a package to help facilitate common layout use-cases.

Currently the package provides a `configurable layout` component which can be used to render components in a grid based on provided templates. This approach is ideal for use-cases such as a custom configurable dashboard. We also provide a fully accessible `accordion` component and an accessible `displayContent` approach to handle loading, error and offline flows.

With all the packages of Studio Hyperdrive we aim to provide components and implementations that are WCAG/WAI-ARIA compliant. This means that rather than making this optional to the implementation, we enforce it throughout the packages.

Where custom input is needed to make the implementation accessible, a `Accessibility` chapter can be found for each implementation.
